# git-backup

[Beta] In case of fire, use `git-backup` ðŸ”¥

> `git-backup` is literally like `git stash`, but **it makes stashes available** on the **remote** for later use

## Usage

```sh
cd some-git-repo/
git-backup
```

and later, if you want to apply the backup:

```sh
cd some-git-repo/
git stash apply <branch-name>
```

For ease of use, you could create a git alias for `git-backup`:

```sh
git config --global alias.backup /path/to/git-backup
```

and then use it just by running `git backup`
